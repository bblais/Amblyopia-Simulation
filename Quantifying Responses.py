# ## Ocular Dominance Index
# 
# Simulations are ended when selectivity has been achieved and the responses are stable. From the maximal responses of each eye, $R_{\text{left}}$ and $R_{\text{right}}$, individually, we can calculate the ocular dominance index as
# $$
# \text{ODI} \equiv \frac{R_{\text{right}}-R_{\text{left}}}{R_{\text{right}}+R_{\text{left}}}
# $$
# The ocular dominance index (ODI) has a value of $\text{ODI} \approx 1$ when stimulus to the right-eye (typically the strong eye in the simulations, by convention) yields a maximum neuronal response with little or no contribution from the left-eye.  Likewise, an ocular dominance index (ODI) has a value of $\text{ODI} \approx -1$ when stimulus to the left-eye (typically the weak eye, by convention) yields a maximum neuronal response with little or no contribution from the right-eye.  A value of $\text{ODI} \approx 0$ represents a purely binocular cell, responding equally to stimulus in either eye.
