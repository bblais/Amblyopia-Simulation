# ## What is Amblyopia?

# Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision loss in children, caused by refractive errors or misalignment of the eyes [@de2007current].    
# 
# 
# - Visual acuity
# - Contrast sensitivity
# - Color
# - Depth (Stereopsis)
# - Motion
# - Visual fields 

# ## How is it Treated?
# 
# The current primary treatment is described in the *Amblyopia Preferred Practice Method* [@wallace2018amblyopia]. Treatments are divided into two broad categories, monocular and binocular treatments. Monocular treatments produce a competition between the two eyes by treating only the fellow eye to that the amblyopic eye recovers.  Binocular treatments seek to stimulate both eyes in such a way that binocular mechanisms can produce a recovery in the amblyopic eye.
# 
# ### Monocular Treatments
# 
# The most common treatment includes 
# 
# 1. the optical correction of significant refractive errors 
# 2. patching the dominant eye which forces the visual input to come from only the amblyopic eye. 
# 
# Although patching is the most common method of treatment, other methods are described including pharmacology and technology [@holmes2016randomized; @Kelly_2016; @Holmes_2016; @Li:2015aa;@de2007current; @Gao_2018;  @glaser2002randomized]. These include,
# 
# 3. Pharmacological treatment with atropine drops in the fellow eye
# 
# Each of these treatments only directly applies to the fellow eye and the amblyopic eye is left untouched. 

# ### Binocular Treatments
# 
# There are some treatments which are administered to both eyes, making them binocular treatments.  The one that we will be addressing here use virtual reality headsets[@xiao2020improved; @xiao2022randomized],
# 
# 4. Virtual reality input to both eyes, with contrast modification and/or  dichoptic masks

# ## Mechanisms for Amblyopia
# 
# Since the unequal visual input to the brain can cause alterations in the synaptic pathways leading to a disparity in ocular dominance [@birch2013amblyopia], it is important to understand the possible synaptic effects amblyopia can produce and how potential treatments will either help or hinder the recovery.
