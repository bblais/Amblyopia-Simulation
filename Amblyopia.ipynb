    "The current primary treatment is described in the *Amblyopia Preferred Practice Method* [@wallace2018amblyopia]. Treatments are divided into two broad categories, monocular and binocular treatments. Monocular treatments produce a competition between the two eyes by treating only the fellow eye to that the amblyopic eye recovers.  Binocular treatments seek to stimulate both eyes in such a way that binocular mechanisms can produce a recovery in the amblyopic eye.\n",
