The mask with $f=10$ has the least overlap between the eyes, whereas the mask with $f=90$ has the most overlap between the eyes.  The mask with the largest overlap between the eyes, the effect of contrast approaches that of no-mask.  As the overlap between the eyes is decreased, by making the mask filter smaller, the rate of recovery is increased for small contrast but *decreased* for larger contrast.  There is even an indication that a small-filter mask combined with nearly equal input to both eyes *will make the deficit worse*.\n",
