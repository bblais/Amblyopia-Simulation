<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision loss in children, caused
by refractive errors or misalignment of the eyes <span class="citation"
data-cites="de2007current">(ZÃ¡rate and Tejedor, 2007)</span>. It is
associated with deficits in many aspects of vision including visual
acuity, contrast sensitivity, color, depth (stereopsis), and motion<span
class="citation" data-cites="birch2013amblyopia">(Birch, 2013)</span>.
The current primary treatments are described in the <em>Amblyopia
Preferred Practice Method</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="wallace2018amblyopia">(Wallace et al., 2018)</span>. These
treatments are divided into two broad categories, monocular and
binocular treatments.</p>
<p>Monocular treatments produce a competition between the two eyes by
treating only the fellow eye so that the amblyopic eye recovers. The
most common treatment includes the optical correction of significant
refractive errors followed by patching the dominant eye which forces the
visual input to come from only the amblyopic eye. Although patching is
the most common method of treatment, other methods include including
pharmacology and technology <span class="citation"
data-cites="holmes2016randomized Kelly_2016 Holmes_2016 Li:2015aa de2007current Gao_2018 glaser2002randomized">(Gao
et al., 2018; Glaser et al., 2002; Jonathan M. Holmes et al., 2016b;
Jonathan M. Holmes et al., 2016a; Kelly et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015;
ZÃ¡rate and Tejedor, 2007)</span>. One such pharmacological treatment is
the application of atropine drops in the fellow eye, resulting in a
decreased efficacy of visual inputs through the fellow eye. Each of the
monocular treatments applies only to the fellow eye and the amblyopic
eye is left untouched.</p>
<p>Binocular treatments seek to stimulate both eyes in such a way that
binocular mechanisms can produce a recovery in the amblyopic eye[<span
class="citation" data-cites="hess2015amblyopia">Hess and Thompson
(2015)</span>; holmes2016randomized]. The binocular treatment that we
will be addressing here uses virtual reality headsets<span
class="citation" data-cites="xiao2020improved xiao2022randomized">(Xiao
et al., 2020, 2022)</span> to provide input to both eyes, with contrast
modification and/or dichoptic masks presented independently to the
amblyopic eye and the fellow eye. Although we focus on this particular
form of binocular treatment, our approach applies equally well to any
proposed treatment protocol.</p>
<p>Since the unequal visual input to the brain can cause alterations in
the synaptic pathways leading to a disparity in ocular dominance <span
class="citation" data-cites="birch2013amblyopia">(Birch, 2013)</span>,
it is important to understand the possible synaptic effects amblyopia
can produce and how potential treatments will either help or hinder the
recovery. This work is an exploration of the problem of modeling
amblyopia and its various treatments using synaptic plasticity models.
The process involves constructing a simplified mechanism for the
development of amblyopic deficits and subsequently modeling both
monocular and binocular treatment protocols. The goal is to understand
the dynamics of the recovery from amblyopic deficits for the different
treatment protocols, to compare the effectiveness of each protocol, and
to explore their limitations. Ideally we would like to use these models
to inform future protocol parameters and perhaps suggest novel
treatments for amblyopia.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="methods"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Methods</h1>
<p>In this paper we use a specific model of neural plasticity, the BCM
model<span class="citation" data-cites="BCM82">(Bienenstock et al.,
1982)</span>, to describe the dynamics of the recovery from amblyopia
under a number of treatment protocols.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="natural-image-input-environment"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Natural Image Input
Environment</h2>
<p>We use natural scene stimuli for the simulated inputs to the visual
system. We start with images taken with a digital camera, with
dimensions 1200 pixels by 1600 pixels scaled down to 600 pixels by 800
pixels (Figure ??). Given the scale invariance of natural images<span
class="citation" data-cites="Ruderman:1994aa">(Ruderman and Bialek,
1994)</span>, angular sizes of images are not useful in establishing the
connection between image pixels and angular measurements. We thus turn
to the literature on the properties of cells in the retinal-LGN-V1
pathway to establish this connection.</p>
<p>The size of LGN receptive fields (RF) and V1 receptive fields are
approximately 3<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> <span
class="citation" data-cites="DeAngelis:1995aa">(DeAngelis et al.,
1995)</span> and 5<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>-8<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>.[<span class="citation"
data-cites="DeAngelis:1995aa">DeAngelis et al. (1995)</span>;
van2010receptive], respectively. We use a Difference-of-Gaussians (DOG)
filter to model the center-surround retinal/LGN processing using filter
sizes <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s=1 \text{pix}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s=3 \text{pix}\)</span> for the
center and surround, respectively. Comparing the LGN RF size (3<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>) to a 2<span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> radius of the
Difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) filter we get an approximate conversion
between images pixels and real-world angular sizes,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
2\sigma_s &amp;\equiv r_{\text{surround}} \\
2r_{\text{surround}} &amp;= 3^\circ = 4\sigma_s = 12 \text{pix} \\
1 \text{pix} &amp;= 0.25^\circ
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(1 \text{pix} = 0.25^\circ\)</span>
as the conversion we then arrive at the V1 RF size: <span
class="math inline">\(5^\circ = 20 \text{pix}\)</span>. For
computational convenience we use a <span class="math inline">\(19
\text{pix}\times 19 \text{pix}\)</span> RF size for our simulations of
the V1 cells, but the results are robust to receptive field size.</p>
<p>The early visual system computes different versions of response
normalization, including the light adaptation of photoreceptors so their
responses reflect <em>contrast</em> (i.e.Â difference from the mean)
rather than intensity directly which allows the photoreceptors to
respond to a wide range of intensities <span class="citation"
data-cites="carandini2012normalization">(Carandini and Heeger,
2012)</span>. We will be using mean-zero inputs for simplicity, this
light adaptation is the same as the following,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R = (I-I_m)/I_\sigma
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the light
intensity, <span class="math inline">\(I_m\)</span> is the average light
intensity (i.e.Â background intensity) and <span
class="math inline">\(I_\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation of the
light intensity (i.e.Â background variation). For small contrast, the
response <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> scales as the intensity.
Ganglion cells add another normalization step, a contrast normalization
effect of a suppressive field<span class="citation"
data-cites="carandini2012normalization">(Carandini and Heeger,
2012)</span>. This is approximately the same as the response
normalization above, applied to the result of a center-surround ganglion
response profile.</p>
<p>To model visual responses, we start with raw grayscale images, whose
values range from 0 to 255. We first apply any external filtering
(e.g.Â optical fix, refractive errors, patch treatments, etcâ¦) to the
images, and then apply the photoreceptor light adaptation and the
ganglion contrast normalization. We model the ganglion response profile
using a 32x32 pixel center-surround difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) filter
to process the images. The center-surround radius ratio used for the
ganglion cell is 1:3, with balanced excitatory and inhibitory regions
and normalized Gaussian profiles. To simplify the number of parameters,
the suppressive field is taken to much larger than the surround field of
the ganglion cell response so we can approximate the ganglion cell
contrast normalization with a simple numerical normalization across the
ganglion responses<span class="citation" data-cites="BlaisEtAl98">(B. S.
Blais et al., 1998)</span>. The resulting processed images are shown in
Figure ??.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" id="two-eye-architecture"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Two-eye architecture</h2>
<p>Shown in Figure ?? is the visual field, approximated here as a
two-dimensional projection, to left and right retinal cells. These left
and right retinal cells project to the left- and right-LGN cells,
respectively, and finally to a single cortical cell. The retinal-LGN
pathway is assumed to result in a center-surround filtering of the input
patterns, as described in Section <a
href="#natural-image-input-environment">2.1</a>. It is important to
understand that the model we are pursuing here is a <em>single cortical
cell</em> which receives input from both eyes. We will encounter some
limitations to this model which may necessitate exploring multi-neuron
systems or a multi-cortical-layer architecture.</p>
<p>In the model, normal development is simulated with image patches
presented to both eyes. These patches are taken from the same image at a
time, and differ between the eyes in two possible ways: jitter and
noise. What we are calling <em>jitter</em> is the difference in location
between the patches between the eyes, specified by two parameters: <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_c\)</span> which is the mean pixel difference
between the patches and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_c\)</span> is
the standard deviation of the pixel differences across many
presentations. For example, if <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_c=0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_c=0\)</span> then the patches presented to
each eye would be identical and if <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_c=3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_c=0\)</span> then every set of image
patches presented would be separated by 3 pixels every time, etcâ¦ What
we are calling <em>noise</em> is random variation of each input
generated from a zero-mean normal distribution of a particular variance,
representing the natural variation in responses of LGN neurons.
Practically, the independent random noise added to each of the two-eye
channels avoids the artificial situation of having mathematically
identical inputs in the channels. The development of the deficit and the
subsequent treatment protocols are modeled with added preprocessing to
these image patches, described later in Sections <a
href="#models-of-development-of-amblyopia">2.5</a> and <a
href="#models-of-treatments-for-amblyopia">2.6</a>.</p>
<p>For all of the simulations we use a 19x19 receptive field, which is a
compromise between speed of simulation and the limits of spatial
discretization. We perform at least 20 independent simulations for each
condition to address variation in the results.</p>

<p>The results are extremely robust to values of <span

practical, rather than theoretical, considerations. Each of these
constants is related to the time-step for the simulations, but given the
phenomenological nature of the BCM theory it is beyond the scope of this
paper to make detailed comparisons between simulation time and
real-time. Further, the fact that <span

100 with no noticeable effect, the experiments presented here cannot be
used address the time-scales of the molecular mechanisms underlying
synaptic modification. Whenever we refer to real-time units for a

<p>In the BCM learning rule, weights decrease if <span

if <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is greater than the

threshold âslidesâ as a super-linear function of the output. The output,
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> , is related to the product of
the inputs and the weights via a sigmoidal function, <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma(\cdot)\)</span>, which places constraints
on the values of the output, keeping it in the range -1 and 50. The
interpretation of negative values is consistent with previous work<span
class="citation" data-cites="BlaisEtAl98">(B. S. Blais et al.,

spontaneous activity. Thus, negative values are interpreted as activity
below spontaneous. We continue this usage, in order to more easily
compare with previous simulations. The role of the spontaneous level for
the simulations in the natural image environment is discussed

the procedure being simulated and then presented to the neuron. After
each input patch is presented, the weights are modified using the output

class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Models of Development of
Amblyopia</h2>
<p>Amblyopia is a reduction of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
with an otherwise normal eye and has many causes<span class="citation"
data-cites="wallace2018amblyopia">(Wallace et al., 2018)</span>. Two of
the most common forms of amblyopia are strabismic and anisometropic
amblyiopia. Strabismic amblyopia occurs when the inputs from each eye do
not converge and the fixating eye becomes dominant over a non-fixating
eye. Refractive amblyopia occurs with untreated unilateral refractive
errors, one kind being anisometropic amblyopia where unequal refractive
power in each eye leads the retinal image from the amblyopic eye to be
blurred relative to the fellow eye. Both of these processes lead to
synaptic plasticity adjustments and interocular competition, enhancing
the initial deficit.</p>
<p>In this work we use a model of the amblyopic deficit caused by two
mechanisms. The first is a blurring of the amblyopic eye inputs,
representing refractive amblyopia. The second is eye-jitter,
representing one source of strabismic amblyopia<span class="citation"
data-cites="Charters:2022aa">(Charters and Ghasia, 2022)</span>. We have
used the approximate values of <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_c=7.5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_c=2\)</span> to represent significant
strabismus â nearly half of a receptive field offset with a strong
variation on the order of 25% of the RF size. We can explore these
mechanisms independently and in conjunction to see how they respond
differentially to the various treatments.</p>

<p>The typical patch treatment is done by depriving the fellow-eye of
input with an eye-patch. In the model this is equivalent to presenting
the fellow-eye (taken to be the right-eye in the simulations) with
random noise instead of the natural image input. Competition between the
left- and right-channels drives the recovery, and is produced from the
difference between <em>structured</em> input into the amblyopic-eye and
the <em>unstructured</em> (i.e.Â noise) input into the fellow eye. It is
not driven by a reduction in input activity. ?? shows sample simulation
input patterns from the patched eye. Compare this to ?? to see that the
simulated patch has far less structure than the normal inputs.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.6.5" id="dichoptic-masks"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6.5</span> Dichoptic Masks</h3>
<p>On top of the contrast modification, we can include the application
of the dichoptic mask. In this method, each eye receives a version of
the input images filtered through independent masks in each channel,
resulting in a mostly-independent pattern in each channel. It has been
observed that contrast modification combined with dichoptic masks can be
an effective treatment for amblyopia<span class="citation"
data-cites="Li:2015aa">Xiao et al. (2022)</span>. The motivation behind
the application of the mask filter is that the neural system must use
both channels to reconstruct the full image and thus may lead to
enhanced recovery.</p>
<p>The dichoptic masks are constructed with the following procedure. A
blank image (i.e.Â all zeros) is made to which is added 15 randomly sized
circles with values equal to 1 (Figure ?? A). These images are then
smoothed with a Gaussian filter of a given width, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (Figure ?? B). This width is a
parameter we can vary to change the overlap between the left- and
right-eye images. A high value of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
compared with the size of the receptive field, e.g.Â <span
class="math inline">\(f=90\)</span>, yields a high overlap between the
patterns in the amblyopic- and fellow-eye inputs (Figure ??). Likewise,
a small value of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, e.g.Â <span
class="math inline">\(f=10\)</span>, the eye inputs are nearly
independent â the patterned activity falling mostly on one of the eyes
and not much to both. Finally, the smoothed images are scaled to have
values from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 1. This image-mask we will
call <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and is the left-eye mask
whereas the right-eye mask, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, is
the inverse of the left-eye mask, <span class="math inline">\(F\equiv
1-A\)</span>. The mask is applied to an image by multiplying the left-
and right-eye images by the left- and right-eye masks, respectively,
resulting in a pair of images which have no overlap at the peaks of each
mask, and nearly equal overlap in the areas of the images where the
masks are near 0.5 (Figure ??).</p>

<p>Figure ?? shows the effect of contrast and dichoptic masks for the
case of no eye-jitter while Figure ?? shows the same for a large
eye-jitter. The mask enhances the rate of recovery for small contrasts
(contrast&lt;0.4), and doesnât affect the cases for high contrast where
there is no recovery. These high-contrast cases have the fellow eye
dominant.</p>

<p>Both Figure ?? and Figure ?? show a marked reverse amblyopia effect
in the time-frame of the simulation â because the recovery rate is so
high. It seems to be tempered somewhat with a sharper mask, but more
simulations need to be run to see if the effect is statistically
significant. This suggests that, in addition to increasing the contrast
of the fellow eye, one could modify the mask to reduce the chance of
reverse amblyopia.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="conclusions-and-discussion"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusions and Discussion</h1>
<p>While the results of this work are promising, there are a number of
limitations. This model is a single-neuron model which means it doesnât
take into account any network effects, such as the balance of excitatory
and inhibitory influences. It also is an early-vision model, so it does
not include any object recognition, higher-order vision processes or
memory processes that may be involved with amblyopia. We measure ocular
dominance for convenience because spatial frequency, which would be a
more natural quantity to use for amblyopia, is to noisy for a model with
19x19 input patches. Finally, this is not a biophysical model, so neuron
spike-effects are not covered.</p>
<p>However, the model does allow one to run many different scenarios
with as few assumptions as possible. It can capture the dynamics of the
learning in the visual system in these scenarios, and allows us to
explore the benefits and drawbacks of different treatment paradigms.</p>
<p>Given that both the contrast of the fellow eye and the dichoptic mask
influence the rate of recovery, one could modify the mask or the
contrast to reduce the chance of reverse amblyopia. One would want
frequent measurements of the inter-eye imbalance to recognize when such
a change is warranted.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.0.1" id="some-lingering-questions"><span
class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Some lingering questions</h3>
<p>Here are just a couple of things I noticed, that I need to look into
to see if there are any issues.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />I would have expected a reverse
amblyopia effect with the patch treatment, but I donât see that. It
might be washed out in the variation at high noise level, but I want to
be sure</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />I would have expected that in the
dichoptic treatment, that the case of contrast=1 with no mask would be
identical to the optical fix at an open-eye noise level of 0.1. I donât
see that, so I am not sure what the difference is</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />I think it would be useful to run a
couple of these cases for more systematic changes in the jitter mean and
standard deviation. There wasnât much of an effect, but it is there in
places and it would be easier to communicate this with a few
examples</label></li>
