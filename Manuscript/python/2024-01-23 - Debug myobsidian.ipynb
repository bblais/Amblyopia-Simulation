      "\n",
      "In this introduction, I want to be clear about as many of the underlying assumptions being made and to highlight where the various results come from in the simulations.   By comparing low-dimension and high-dimension environments, it's my hope that it will make clearer what sorts of changes to the input environment will lead to particular dynamics of synaptic plasticity.  Building up one's intuition this way should help in proposing alternate treatments for amblyopia and understanding how the parameters of those treatments affect their outcomes. \n",

      "## The Neuron\n",
      "\n",
      "The BCM theory[@BCM82] of synaptic plasticity starts with a simplified model of a neuron shown in [Figure @fig:simple-neuron-pdf].  In the figure, the model of the neuron has 4 inputs denoted as $x_1, x_2, x_3,$ and $x_4$.  These inputs are connected to the cell via 4 synaptic weights, denoted as $w_1, w_2, w_3,$ and $w_4$.  The output of the cell, $y$, is given as a sum of the input values each multiplied by the synaptic weight connecting it to the neuron passed through an output function, often a sigmoid, $\\sigma$:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "y=\\sigma\\left(\\sum_i x_i w_i \\right)\n",
      "$$\n",
      "In this simple model, the value of neural activity $x_i=0$ or $y=0$ refers to *spontaneous activity*, thus one can have negative values for this activity representing *below spontaneous* activity.  The sigmoid function is chosen to have the effect of limiting the spontaneous level of activity, i.e. the neuron has a larger range of activity above spontaneous then below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The synapse values, $w_i$, may represent the combination of several synapses -- including inhibitory synapses -- which implies that the weights can take on both positive and negative values.   The number of inputs (4 in the case of  [Figure @fig:simple-neuron-pdf]) is arbitrary and will be different from one environment to another.  What is called a \"low-dimensional\" environment is one with few inputs, likewise a \"high-dimensional\" environment will have many (possibly hundreds).\n",

In [Equation @eq:bcm1], the weights increase if the output, $y$, is above the threshold, $\\theta_M$, and decrease if the output is below the threshold. The sliding threshold, $\\theta_M$, follows postsynaptic activity in a non-linear way ([Equation @eq:bcm2]) and serves to stabilize any runaway weights and the combination of the two equations enforces the selectivity property of the BCM neuron[@phd:Blais98].  The constant, $\\eta$, refers to the learning rate and the constant, $\\tau$, is what we call the memory constant and is related to the speed of the sliding threshold.  These parameters influence the overall rate of synaptic plasticity and are generally held constant for any series of simulations so that relative dynamics can be compared.\n",
