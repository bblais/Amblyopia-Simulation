shorttitle: BCM and Amblyopia

abstract: This document should serve as an introduction to the BCM Theory [@BCM82] of cortical plasticity, using the development and treatment for amblyopia as the scientific problem to be explored.  We will explore both low-dimensional abstract environments as well as visual environments based on natural-image input to understand the dynamics of synaptic plasticity.
