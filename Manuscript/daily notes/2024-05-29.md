## Questions/tasks 

#todo 

- [x] #somedaymaybe effect of suppressive field like [@bonin2005suppressive]
- [ ] terminology - is it fellow eye or sound eye?
- [ ] cases of reverse amblyopia - patch for a long time - reduce noise over time
- [ ] cases of reverse amblyopia - mask/contrast for a long time - reduce mask/contrast over time
- [ ] what about $f=1$ or smaller?  what is the limit?  I'd expect at a certain point there would not be recovery
- [ ] find the result that Eric thought was significant
- [x] go through the daily notes
- [x] rerun each of the sets of simulations
- [ ] is there a comparable sim for this: clinical result -- better to start treatment rather than treat the strabismus first - do an extreme strabismus $\mu_c$ and then do the mask treatment, and then fix the strabismus vs strabismus then fix then mask.
