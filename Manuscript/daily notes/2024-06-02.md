An interesting observation.  When doing a large noise 2D example, I ran into this weird problem:

- Neuron min/max -1,50. and noise level 1 laplace level 1

- Neuron min/max -1,50. and **noise level 1.5** laplace level 1

- Neuron **min/max -0.5**,50. and noise level 1.5 laplace level 1

So, lowering the abs of the min makes the neuron able to find the structure again.  

#todo 
- [ ] Why is this?  How does this affect the other sims?
