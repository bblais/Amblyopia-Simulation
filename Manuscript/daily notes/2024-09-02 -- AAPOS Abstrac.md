INTRODUCTION

Recent advent and application of digital technologies to amblyopia therapy affords tremendous opportunity to broaden and enhance treatment. Optimal modifications of visual input during treatment have been predicated on a large literature of human psychophysics that seek to optimize binocular function.  However, the near infinite potential modifications and combinations of eye-selective visual input cannot be practically tested in dedicated clinical trials.  

METHODS
We developed a computational model of amblyopia development and recovery that is rooted in key basic science-based principles of synaptic plasticity.  

RESULTS
Using this model we assessed the speed and efficacy of responses to standard occlusion and penalization treatments and compared these with graded variants of recently developed therapeutic modifications.  This model can address key clinical questions such as whether strabismus and fixation instability themselves are barriers to recovery and what are the optimal dichoptic conditions to promote recovery from amblyopia.  

CONCLUSION
These questions may resist standard clinical procedure due to confounding factors (e.g. fixation instability may relate to the earlier onset and thus more severe/recalcitrant amblyopia) or are simply impractical from a clinical perspective but are straightforward for a computational model.  The model can be further developed to incorporate additional features of synaptic plasticity (such as spike-timing dependence) and tailored to fit real-world scenarios that improve its clinical fidelity and help streamline the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
