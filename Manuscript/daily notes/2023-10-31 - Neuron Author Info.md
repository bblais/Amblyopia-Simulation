# How to prepare and submit research articles

You can submit your manuscript using our online submission system, [Editorial Manager (EM)](http://www.editorialmanager.com/neuron/?__hstc=25856994.6356df83aec2ba38f5908e6f3242350d.1698417867700.1698430305248.1698762548520.3&__hssc=25856994.10.1698762548520&__hsfp=1658081462). For assistance, please contact us at [neuron@cell.com](mailto:neuron@cell.com) or +1-617-397-2800.

[Editorial Manager](http://www.editorialmanager.com/neuron/?__hstc=25856994.6356df83aec2ba38f5908e6f3242350d.1698417867700.1698430305248.1698762548520.3&__hssc=25856994.10.1698762548520&__hsfp=1658081462) will send all communications (including the request for final approval and the confirmation of submission) to the person who is selected as corresponding author at submission or, if no name is designated, to the person whose account is used to submit the manuscript. If you want to specify a different author for correspondence after submission, please contact the editorial operations associate at [neuron@cell.com](mailto:neuron@cell.com).

# Cover letter

In your cover letter, please explain what was previously known, the conceptual advance provided by your work, and the significance to a broad readership. You may suggest appropriate reviewers and make up to three requests for reviewer exclusions. Please use the cover letter to notify us of information that is relevant to our handling and evaluation your paper (e.g., related work, time constraints, competition). The cover letter is confidential and will not be seen by reviewers.

# Initial submissions

For initial submissions, you do not need to strictly adhere to every formatting guideline in the sections below, nor do you need to provide a graphical abstract, highlights, or an eTOC paragraph. However, we do ask that you stay close to our length restrictions, adhere to figure limitations, and use page numbers. For information about length/figure restrictions for specific article types, please see our [article types page](http://www.cell.com/neuron/article-types).

We recommend uploading your manuscript and other related files individually. By submitting your manuscript as a Word file, it may allow for Editorial Manager to automatically identify and extract the title, author list and affiliations, and abstract of your paper, helping to ease the submission process. Alternatively, for initial submissions, you can upload your paper as a single combined PDF. In doing this, you can intersperse the figures and figure legends within the results section to aid evaluation of your paper. In either case, Editorial Manager will build a composite PDF of submitted files for editorial and reviewer consideration. This composite PDF will contain links that editors and reviewers can use to download individual high-resolution files (for figures which have been submitted in JPEG, TIFF, or EPS format). The version of the composite PDF that is shared with reviewers will not include a cover letter or any reviewer preferences. We require that the composite PDF is kept below 20MB to ease editorial and reviewer consideration.

# Formatting guidelines

All research article formats at Cell Press generally contain the following sections in this order: title, authors, affiliations, author list footnotes, corresponding author(s) email address(es), summary, introduction, results, discussion, acknowledgments, author contributions, declaration of interests, figure titles and legends, tables with titles and legends, STAR Methods, supplemental information titles and legends, and references. The text (title through references) should be provided as one document. Figures, supplemental information, and the key resources table should be provided separately.

Gene symbols should be italicized; protein products of the loci are not italicized. Nonstandard abbreviations should be defined when first used in the text. Use of abbreviations should be kept at a minimum.

### Title

Titles should:

- Be concise, around 10-12 words (no more than 145 characters total, including spaces)
- Avoid the use of jargon and uncommon abbreviations
- Capture the broad conceptual significance of the work

### Author list

- Author first and last names should be spelled out in their entirety (e.g., do not abbreviate "J.H. Watson" unless this is how the author's name always appears). Middle initials are OK.
- Please check your co-author names very carefully. After the paper's acceptance, any changes to the author list will require approval of the handling editor and all co-authors; after publication, any changes will additionally require a formal correction notice to alert readers.

### Author affiliations and footnotes

- Institutional affiliations should be signified with numbered footnotes. 
- Affiliations should contain the following information at minimum: department(s)/subunit(s), institution, city, state/region (if applicable), and country.
- After the institutional affiliations, numbered footnotes may be used to indicate an author's present address, equal contribution, and/or senior authorship.
- Corresponding authors (see below) may additionally include Twitter handles as a means of contact.
- The final numbered footnote should indicate which author is the paper's lead contact (required).

### Contact information

- One author must be designated as the lead contact. There can be no more than one lead contact. 
- The lead contact must be designated as a corresponding author.
- Additional authors may also be noted as corresponding authors.
- All corresponding authors should be indicated with an asterisk (*) in the author list. Use 2 asterisks (**) for the second-listed corresponding author, 3 (***) for the third-listed, and so on. 
- The email address(es) of the corresponding author(s) should be listed after the author list footnotes (e.g., "*Correspondence: john_doe@cell.com").
- Please list only one email address per corresponding author.

For more on author lists, affiliations, footnotes, and contact information, please see the editorial policies on authorship.

# Summary

The summary is a single paragraph no longer than 150 words. An effective summary includes the following elements: (1) a brief background of the question that avoids statements about how a process is not well understood; (2) a description of the results and approaches/model systems framed in the context of their conceptual interest; and (3) an indication of the broader significance of the work. We discourage novelty claims (e.g., use of the word “novel”) because they are overused, tend not to add meaning, and are difficult to verify. Please do not include references in the summary. 

### Keywords

After the summary, you may include up to 10 keywords with your paper, separated by commas. These keywords will be associated with your paper on Cell Press platforms and on PubMed and other abstract indexing platforms.

# Introduction

Good introductions are succinct, presenting only the background information needed for readers to understand the motivation for the study and the results. No subheadings, please.

# Results

This section should be divided with subheadings. In our view, good subheadings convey information about the findings, so we encourage you to be specific. For example, say "Factor X requires factor Y to function in process Z" rather than "Analysis of factors X and Y using approach Q."  We recommend that you use similar language in your figure titles for clarity and structural harmony. 

# Discussion

The discussion should explain the significance of the results and place them into a broader context. It is often helpful to the reader to indicate the directions in which the work might be built on going forward. It should not be redundant with the results. The discussion may contain subheadings and can be combined with the results section.

### Acknowledgments

Use this section to acknowledge contributions from non-authors and list funding sources. If this work was enabled due to contributions of a core facility or shared resource at your institution, we encourage you to acknowledge those contributions as well. As this section contains important information and many funding bodies require inclusion of grant numbers here, please check it carefully.

# Author contributions

This section is required for all papers. Please use it to concisely describe each author’s contributions, using initials to indicate each author’s identity. We encourage you to use [the CRediT taxonomy](http://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/guidelines/CRediT-taxonomy.pdf), but you can also use a traditional format (e.g., "A.B. and C.D. conducted the experiments; E.F. designed the experiments and wrote the paper.").

# Declaration of interests

This section is required for all papers. Please use it to disclose any competing interests, in accordance with [Cell Press's declaration of interests policy](http://www.cell.com/declaration-of-interests). If there are no interests to declare, please note that with the following wording: "The authors declare no competing interests." The text in this section should match the text provided in the [declaration of interests form](http://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/forms/di_form.pdf).

# Figure legends

Legends should be included in the submitted manuscript as a separate section. Each figure legend should have a brief title that describes the entire figure without citing specific panels, followed by a description of each panel. In writing the figure title, we encourage you to re-use the subheadings of the results section to make the relationship clear. For any figures presenting pooled data, the measures should be defined in the figure legends (for example, "Data are represented as mean ± SEM."). Each legend should refer to any supporting items in the supplemental information (e.g., "See also Figure S1.").

# Tables

Please use the Microsoft Word table function to make tables; you may need to revise any tables that are not created using this function. Tables should include a title, and footnotes and/or legend should be concise. Include tables in the submitted manuscript as a separate section. 

When creating tables, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Do not submit tables in Excel or PDF format. Do not place an Excel table in a Word document.
    
- Format tables with Word's table function; do not use tabs or spaces to create a table.
    
- Tables should not include colored text or shading, but embedded graphics with color are OK.
    
- Do not use line breaks or spaces to separate data within a cell. Use separate cells for all discrete data elements within a table.
    
- Number distinct tables as Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, etc., rather than as Table 1a, Table 1b, Table 1c, etc.
    
- If bold or italic font is used within a table to indicate some feature of the data, please give an explanation of its usage in the legend.
    
- All abbreviations within a table must be defined in the table legend or footnotes.
    
- Footnotes should be listed with superscript lowercase letters, beginning with “a.” Footnotes may not be listed with numbers or symbols.

### References

Please adhere to the following guidelines, as well as the style shown in the provided examples. [CSL](https://www.zotero.org/styles) and [EndNote](https://endnote.com/downloads/styles/) styles are also available if desired.

- References should be sequentially numbered according to their first citation in the manuscript.
- References cited in the SI and ONLY in the SI should appear ONLY in the SI, not in the main text.
- Each reference should contain only one article and may not contain parts a, b, c, etc.
- Note that "et al." should be used only after 10 author names. 
- In-text citations should be written in numbered superscript style, e.g., "Multiple reports support this observation1,2" or "This observation is supported by Smith et al.1"
- Please include only material that is published or in press. We encourage the inclusion of digital object identifiers (DOIs) whenever possible.
- For in press articles, please confirm with the cited journal that the article is in fact in press, and include a DOI and scheduled online publication date.
- Preprints may be included with appropriate identification information and an independent persistent identifier, such as a DOI. If a preprint has subsequently become available as a peer-reviewed publication, please use the formal publication data instead.
- Unpublished data (including manuscripts submitted and/or under review), abstracts, and personal communications may be cited within the text but should not appear in the reference list. Unpublished articles should be cited as “unpublished data,” “data not shown,” or “personal communication,” and any cited personal communications should be documented by a letter of permission.
- All datasets, program code, and methods used in your manuscript must be appropriately cited in the text and listed in the reference section either in the form of the publications in which they were first reported or in the form of independent persistent identifiers, such as DOIs. When a dataset, program code, or method has a persistent identifier independent from the original study in which it was first reported, we encourage you to cite both that identifier and the original study.

# How to prepare and submit revised/final files

In addition to the sections required for initial submissions, revised manuscripts must also contain a detailed point-by-point response to the comments of the reviewers and/or editors. The cover letter should briefly summarize how the revised manuscript addresses these comments. In general, we allow 3 months for revision; if you think you might need more time, please contact the handling editor for guidance.

The final submission should also contain highlights and an eTOC blurb. These items will appear with the online version of the paper and on the PDF cover page. We have provided [a handy checklist](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/EM/MasterFFCs/NEURONFFC-1692637222507.pdf) for preparing the final version of your paper.





# Editorial policies

# Preprint servers

We are happy to consider manuscripts previously posted on preprint servers such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [BioRN](https://www.ssrn.com/en/index.cfm/biorn/), [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/), [ChemRN](https://www.ssrn.com/en/index.cfm/chemrn/) or [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/en/). Three of our broad scope journals, Cell Reports, Current Biology, and iScience, also support direct submission of manuscripts from bioRxiv via transfer of manuscript files and metadata to the journal’s Editorial Manager site. Our support for posting of preprints only applies to the original submitted version of the manuscript; we do not support posting to preprint servers revisions that respond to editorial input and peer review or final accepted manuscripts. Once your paper is published, we encourage you to update the preprint record with a link to the final published article. Please see our [prepublication publicity policy](https://www.cell.com/neuron/authors#prepub) for more information on sharing your work at the prepublication stage.

## Data and code availability

As a Cell Press author, you must be willing to share all of the data and original code you report in your published paper with the research community unless there is a countervailing legal or ethical prohibition (e.g., the data are confidential medical records). Your paper must include a comprehensive and accurate “data and code availability” statement that describes the steps you have taken or will take to make your data and original code available after publication. We strongly recommend that you archive all of the unprocessed data and original code that your paper reports in an online repository that meets the criteria for digital longevity, implementation of FAIR standards, and community support as [articulated by Fairsharing.org and collaborators](https://zenodo.org/record/4084763#.X9zIB-lKhTa). Note that should issues arise after publication, failing to produce your data can be grounds for retraction.

Cell Press has specific requirements for datatypes that have community-endorsed, datatype-specific repositories. We call these datatypes “standardized datatypes.” Examples of standardized datatypes include -seq, proteomics, and crystallography. A list of datatypes considered standardized under Cell Press policy is available [here](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cellpress/data/RecommendRepositories-1690982749847.pdf). A list of datatype-specific repositories that have been recommended by Cell Press is available [here](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cellpress/data/RecommendRepositories-1690982749847.pdf).

[This author’s guide](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cellpress/data/AuthorsJourney-1621989651830.pdf) describes how standardized datasets and original code accompany Cell Press manuscripts from submission through publication. Please note that it illustrates general practices; editors will provide guidance about specific cases. Exceptions to these requirements can be made for individual datasets when sharing data is legally or ethically prohibited. These cases should be discussed with editors as early as possible, ideally upon submission.

# Authorship

Our authorship policy accommodates diverse types of research, providing a framework that makes clear the contributions of each author.

_Author contributions section:_ To make author contributions transparent, all research articles should include an author contributions section. Please describe the contributions concisely and use initials to indicate author identity. We encourage you to use the CRediT taxonomy, which offers standardized descriptions of author contributions. An authors contributions section is not required for front-matter articles.

_Corresponding author and lead contact:_ You must designate at least one corresponding author and only one lead contact.

_Corresponding author:_ We prefer that each paper have a single corresponding author because we think that the ownership and responsibility that are inherent in corresponding authorship will promote best practices in design and performance of experiments, analysis of results, organization and retention of original data, and preparation of figures and text.

That said, we understand that, for some studies, particularly for interdisciplinary ones, multiple authors may bear the responsibilities of a corresponding author. If you feel strongly and have compelling reasons, you may include additional corresponding authors. We may ask you to explain your rationale and to verify that all corresponding authors understand their responsibilities (listed below). We ask that you describe each corresponding author's specific contributions in the author contributions section.

_Lead contact:_ The lead contact is the corresponding author who is also responsible for communicating with the journal (before and after publication) and conveying any relevant information or updates to co-authors and is accountable for fulfilling requests for reagents and resources and for arbitrating decisions and disputes. For research papers with multiple corresponding authors, please designate one (and only one) corresponding author as the lead contact. If there is only one corresponding author, then that author is automatically also the lead contact. You should denote the lead contact with a footnote in the author list (e.g., "5Lead contact").

_Responsibilities of the corresponding author and lead contact:_ All corresponding authors bear responsibilities 1–8 below; the lead contact additionally bears responsibility 9.

1. Supervising the work
    
2. Being responsible for all data, figures, and text
    
3. Ensuring that authorship is granted appropriately to contributors
    
4. Ensuring that all authors approve the content and submission of the paper, as well as edits made through the revision and production processes
    
5. Ensuring adherence to all editorial and submission policies
    
6. Identifying and declaring competing interests on behalf of all authors 
    
7. Identifying and disclosing related work by any co-authors under consideration elsewhere
    
8. Archiving unprocessed data and ensuring that figures accurately present the original data (see [data and code availability](https://www.cell.com/neuron/authors#code) section)
    
9. Arbitrating decisions and disputes and ensuring communication with the journal (before and after publication), sharing of any relevant information or updates to co-authors, and accountability for fulfillment of requests for reagents and resources
    

_Equal contributions:_ The lead contact is the only designation that we strictly limit to one author. In addition to noting corresponding authors with an asterisk, you may use numbered footnotes to designate senior authors and otherwise equally contributing authors. The following footnote should be used for authors who have made equal contributions: “6These authors contributed equally”. Senior authors can be designated with a footnote, e.g., “6Senior author”. Please use the author contributions section of the manuscript to more fully describe each author’s specific contributions.  

_Authorship disputes:_ All authors should discuss and agree on author order and authorship designations. We expect that everyone listed as an author contributed substantively to the paper.

We do not adjudicate authorship disputes. These disputes should be resolved by the researchers involved and/or their institutions. If we become aware of a dispute we will suspend consideration of the paper until the dispute is resolved. In this case (and when authors request changes to authorship) authorship should be approved in writing by all authors.

## Competing interests

Transparency is essential for a reader’s trust in the scientific process and for the credibility of published articles. At Cell Press, we believe that disclosure of competing interests is a critical aspect of transparency. 

### Competing interests for authors

We require that all authors disclose any financial or other interests related to the submitted work that (1) could affect, or have the perception of affecting, the author’s objectivity, or (2) could influence, or have the perception of influencing, the content of the article.

Examples of financial and non-financial interests that should be reported include: stocks or shares in companies with interests related to the submitted work or consulting fees from companies that could have interests related to the work, professional affiliations, advisory positions, board memberships (including membership on a journal’s advisory board when publishing in that journal), or patent holdings that are related to the subject matter of the contribution. As a guideline, authors need to declare an interest for (1) any affiliation associated with a payment or financial benefit exceeding $10,000 p.a. or 5% ownership of a company or (2) research funding by a company with related interests. You do not need to disclose diversified mutual funds, 401ks, or investment trusts. Authors should also disclose relevant financial interests of immediate family members. Cell Press uses the Public Health Service definition of “immediate family member,” which includes spouses and dependent children.

We require authors to disclose any competing interests in a “[declaration of interests](https://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/forms/di_form-1690982144780.pdf)” form, which must be submitted alongside their manuscript for all article types, and in a “declaration of interests” section in the text of all articles. This section should include financial or other competing interests as well as affiliations that are not included in the author list. Primary affiliations should be included on the title page of the manuscript with the author list and do not need to be included in the “declaration of interests” section. Funding sources should be included in the “acknowledgments” section and also do not need to be included in the “declaration of interests” section. If there are no competing interests to declare, the declaration of interests statement should read “The authors declare no competing interests.” For all peer-reviewed content, the declaration of interest form will be shared with reviewers.

https://www.cell.com/neuron/author-resources

# Cell Press digital image guidelines

On this page, we provide tools and guidelines for creating high-quality figures and images that are optimized for submission to Cell Press journals, including information on data processing and obtaining permissions for reprinted images. Please review these guidelines and make sure that your figures and images meet our requirements. If you have any questions, please contact the respective journal's editorial operations associate.

## Figures

Files should be provided in accordance with the following:

### General guidelines

- Each figure should fit on a single 8.5” x 11” page
- Figures should be submitted as separate image files rather than be embedded in the manuscript; please do not send figure panels individually
- For initial submission, we prefer TIFF or PDF files, but we will also accept JPEG or EPS files; PDF file size should be less than 3 MB
- For final production, we prefer high-resolution TIFF, PDF, or CDX (ChemDraw) files; each file should be no more than 20 MB
    - NOTE: The journal _Cell_ prefers source files (AI, PSD, or PPT) for Leading Edge figures
    - NOTE: If possible, please create and save ChemDraw files on a PC rather than a Mac because Mac-created files may occasionally lose certain details (e.g., symbols) when processed on a PC, which we use in production
- For color figures, the resolution should be 300 dpi at the desired print size
- For black and white figures, the resolution should be 500 dpi at the desired print size
- For line-art figures, the resolution should be 1,000 dpi at the desired print size
- Make sure that any raster artwork within the source document is at the appropriate minimum resolution
- If used, color should be encoded as RGB, and to accommodate all viewers, red and green should not be used together
- Always embed fonts and use only Arial fonts
- Different panels should be labeled with capital letters
- Text should be about 6–8 pt at the desired print size
- Limit vertical space between parts of an illustration to only what is necessary for visual clarity
- Line weights or stroke widths should be in the 0.5–1.5 pt range
- Gray fills should be kept at least 20% different from other fills and no lighter than 10% or darker than 80%
- When using layers, reduce to one layer (flatten Artwork) before saving your image (except for the journal _Cell_)
- A scale bar, rather than magnification, must be provided for any micrographs

NOTE: Please review the data processing policy at the bottom of this page and confirm that your figures and manuscript adhere to this policy.

### Journal-specific guidelines

Please note the following journal-specific figure sizes:

_AJHG, Cell, Cancer Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Genomics, Cell Host & Microbe, Cell Metabolism, Cell Reports, Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell, HGG Advances, Immunity, Molecular Cell, Molecular Therapy and sister journals, **Neuron**, One Earth, Patterns, Stem Cell Reports, Structure_, and _The Innovation_:

- For 2-column formats (such as research articles and reviews), the sizes are 85 mm (1 column), 114 mm (1.5 columns), and 174 mm (full width of the page)
- For 3-column formats (such as previews and commentaries), the sizes are 55 mm (1 column), 114 mm (2 columns), and 174 mm (full width of the page)

_Cell Reports Physical Science, Chem, Chem Catalysis, Joule, Matter_, and _Med_:

- For 1-column formats (such as research articles and reviews), the sizes are 112 mm (1 column) and 172 mm (full width of the page)
- For 3-column formats (such as previews and commentaries), the sizes are 53 mm (1 column), 112 mm (2 columns), and 172 mm (the full width of the page)

_iScience_ and _STAR Protocols_:

- For all formats, the sizes are 134.6 mm (1 column) and 172 mm (full width of the page)

## File types

TIFF, PDF, and CDX (ChemDraw) files are the preferred types for final production files.

### TIFF

Virtually all common artwork-creation software is capable of saving files in TIFF format. TIFF is the recommended file format for bitmap, grayscale, and color images. TIFF supports several good compression schemes, ensuring that file sizes are kept to a minimum to aid easy file transfer. The LZW compression option should always be used.

### CDX

CDX files are preferred for chemical structures. ChemDraw settings should be as follows:

- Chain bond angle = 120°
- Fixed bond angle = 15°
- Bond length = 0.45 cm
- Bond width = 0.015 cm
- Bold bond width = 0.05 cm
- Double bond space = 20% of bond length
- Stereo bond width = 0.056 cm
- Hash spacing = 0.065 cm
- Captions and atom labels* = Arial, 7 pt
- Atom labels "Show labels on Terminal Carbons" and "Hide Implicit Hydrogens" should be unchecked.

For initial submission, ChemDraw files must either be embedded in the text or supplied separately as TIFF or PDF files. For final submission, please use our [one-column](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/chem/templates/chemdraw-one-column-1471006839487.cdx) or [full-page template](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/chem/templates/chemdraw-full-width-1471006841673.cdx).

NOTE: If possible, please create and save ChemDraw files on a PC rather than a Mac because Mac-created files may occasionally lose certain details (e.g., symbols) when processed on a PC, which we use in production.

### EPS

Virtually all common artwork-creation software is capable of saving files in EPS format.

### MS Office (Word, Excel, PPT figures)

Please convert your MS Office files to PDF. Make sure that any artwork placed into MS Office applications is at the appropriate minimum resolution. Do not reduce or enlarge any images after placement in an MS Office application, as this can lead to loss of image quality. 

### AI (Illustrator)

The AI file type should only be used for Leading Edge figures in the journal _Cell_. Please embed all fonts when saving your AI files. Please embed all images when saving your AI files (to embed external images, please refer to the "links" menu in Illustrator). If fonts or images are not properly embedded, they may drop out during reproduction or printing.

## File sizes for articles under review

For newly submitted articles or revisions still under review, please keep figure files as small as possible (1–2 MB) so that editors and reviewers can more easily work with the files. If your article is accepted for publication, we will request higher-quality production figure files if necessary.

## Solutions to common figure problems

### File types not accepted by editorial manager

Editorial Manager accepts TIFF, PDF, CDX, JPEG, and EPS files. Other formats should be converted to one of these accepted file types. Virtually all common artwork-creation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canvas, ChemDraw, CorelDraw, SigmaPlot, Origin Lab, and others, is capable of saving files in PDF format. This option can normally be found under the "Save As" or "Export" commands in the "File" menu.

### Files are too large

We place an upper limit of 20 MB on individual figure files. To reduce file size, you may try flattening layers or downsampling the file if the resolution exceeds our guidelines. If you are working with TIFF files, please use LZW compression. If you are working with PDF files, you may try selecting the "Reduced Size PDF" option from the File > Save As menu. If you are unable to reduce the file size below 20 MB without a loss of quality, please contact the journal's editorial operations associate for help.

## Figure360

Authors are also encouraged to submit Figure360 videos to accompany their static figures. Each F360 video focuses on one figure from the article and is published alongside that figure. There is no limit to the number of figures that can be accompanied by a F360 video; however, each video must focus on only one figure. Videos are generally 2–3 minutes long and give readers a fun way to quickly and effectively grasp the major points of that figure. For additional information, examples, and instructions on how to create a Figure360 video, please visit our [Figure360 page for authors](https://www.cell.com/figure360). 

## Graphical abstracts

Please refer to the [Cell Press graphical abstracts guidelines(opens in a new window)](https://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/figureguidelines/GA_guide-1537202744020.pdf) page for examples of and comprehensive instructions for graphical abstracts.

The graphical abstract is one single-panel, square image that is designed to give readers an immediate understanding of the take-home message of the paper. Its intent is to encourage browsing, promote interdisciplinary scholarship, and help readers quickly identify which papers are most relevant to their research interests.

Technical requirements are as follows:

- Size: 1,200 pixels _**square**_ at 300 dpi
- Font: Arial, 12–16 points; smaller fonts will not be legible online
- Accepted file types: TIFF, PDF, JPEG
- Content: the graphical abstract should consist of one single panel

Please note that not all Cell Press journals publish graphical abstracts. If you are unsure of whether the journal that you are publishing in accepts graphical abstracts, please consult the journal's information for authors page.

## Data processing policy

Authors should make every attempt to reduce the amount of post-acquisition processing of data. Some degree of processing may be unavoidable in certain instances and is permitted provided that the final data accurately reflect that of the original. In the case of image processing, alterations must be applied to the entire image (e.g., brightness, contrast, color balance). In rare instances for which this is not possible (e.g., alterations to a single color channel on a microscopy image), any alterations must be clearly stated in both the figure legend and the methods section. Groupings and consolidation of data (e.g., cropping of images or removal of lanes from gels and blots) must be made apparent and should be explicitly indicated in the appropriate figure legends. Data comparisons should only be made from comparative experiments, and individual data should not be utilized across multiple figures. In cases in which data are used multiple times (e.g., multiple experiments were performed simultaneously with a single control experiment), this must be clearly stated in both the figure legend and the methods section. In the event that it is deemed necessary for proper evaluation of the manuscript, authors will be required to make the original unprocessed data available to the editors of the journal. All accepted manuscripts will be taken through a data presentation image screening process before publication.

## Permissions

If you want to reprint or adapt images from published Cell Press or Elsevier articles, you do not need to ask our permission. [Our policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/copyright#Author%20rights) only requires that you cite the original publication in the figure legend.

If you want to reprint images from copyrighted work from other publishers in your article, you must obtain written permission (e.g., via RightsLink) from the copyright owners and cite the original publication in an appropriate credit line (the wording of which is usually mandated by the publisher in the copyright license you receive).

If you have adapted a published figure, you may or may not need permission from the copyright owner, depending on how much the adaptation resembles the original. When in doubt, check with the copyright owner and cite the original article. 

Obtaining permission can take several weeks. To avoid any delays to publication, we recommend that you seek permission before or at the time of submission. For information about how to request permission to use copyrighted material, including work published elsewhere at Elsevier, please visit our [permissions page](https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/copyright/permissions).
