## Questions/tasks 

#todo 

- [ ] find the "best" jitter and blur
- [ ] Sims to do:
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction -> patch
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction -> atropine
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction -> contrast only
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction -> mask only
	- [ ] deficit -> optical correction -> contrast +mask
- [ ] answer question - are there cases it's best to change the contrast, or the mask, mid-treatment to avoid reverse amblyopia?
- [ ] conclusions and limitations
