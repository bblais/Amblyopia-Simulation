# Conclusions and Discussion

While the results of this work are promising, there are a number of limitations.  This model is a single-neuron model which means it doesn't take into account any network effects, such as the balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences.  It also is a early vision-system model, so it does not include any object recognition or higher-order vision or memory processes that may be involved with amblyopia.  As a result, any center-surround interactions are also not captured by the model.  Finally, this is not a biophysical model, so neuron spike-effects are not covered.  

However, the model does allow one to run many different scenarios with as few assumptions as possible.  It can capture the dynamics of the learning in the visual system in these scenarios, and allow us to explore the benefits and drawbacks of different treatment paradigms.
