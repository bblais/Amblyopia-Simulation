## Results on Modeling Treatments for Amblyopia

As expected, the recovery from the deficit using the glasses treatment depends on the open-eye noise, with greater recovery occurring for larger noise level (Figure [@fig:glasses_treatment]).  This is due to the fact that larger presynaptic activity drives larger weight changes, and the lack of structure in the noise drives the neuron to find the structure in the now-identical eye inputs.  The patch treatment (Figure [@fig:patch_treatment]) has a larger effect on recovery, again with larger noise resulting in faster recovery.   The reason for the enhanced recovery speed is that patch treatment sets up a direct competition between the structure presented to the amblyopic eye and the noise presented to the fellow eye.  

Like patch, applying an atropine-like blur the fellow eye results in a recovery (Figure [@fig:atropine_treatment]) that depends on the noise level but also on the magnitude of the blur.  For a sufficiently larger blur, the patch and atropine treatments are roughly comparable.

Using a treatment constructed from a contrast reduction in the fellow eye along with dichoptic masks can produce a recovery more pronounced than any of the monocular treatments (Figure [@fig:contrast_mask_treatment]).  This recovery depends on the level of contrast and the size of the mask, with smaller masks and a contrast level around 0.3 being optimum.   If the contrast difference is not set low enough, the smaller mask enhances the competition between the fellow eye and the amblyopic eye resulting in a *worsening* of the amblyopia.  However contrast treatment alone doesn't provide an optimal recovery -- the combination of both contrast reduction and the dichoptic mask is needed.  The result is surprisingly robust to eye jitter (Figure [@fig:contrast_mask_treatment_mu9_sigma_9]) with a mean jitter of half of the receptive field and a standard deviation of the jitter equal to the mean giving the same effect, with only added variation as the primary difference.  There does seem to be in decrease in range of contrasts which result in a worsening amblyopia, which may be the result of the jitter giving a more variable deficit in the first place and thus more options for recovery.
