## Refractory and Strabismic Amblyopia

Figure @fig:deficit-mu_c-blur shows the production of a deficit effect using both refractory blurring and inter-eye jitter.  Interestingly the larger jitter offset, for small amounts of blur, reduces both the deficit.  While both variables increase the ODI shift to the stronger eye, the jitter has a more modest effect (Figure @fig:deficit-ODI-mu_c-blur).

> Maximum response for the deprived- and normal-input channels as function of the deficit blur size (in pixels) and the mean jitter offset ($\mu_c$).  Interestingly the larger  jitter offset, for small amounts of blur, reduces both the deficit.
