## Refractory and Strabismic Amblyopia

Figure @fig:deficit-mu_c-blur shows the production of a deficit effect using both refractory blurring and inter-eye jitter.  Interestingly the larger  jitter offset has a more enhanced effect for small amounts of blur.  While both variables increase the ODI shift to the stronger eye, the jitter has a more modest effect (Figure @fig:deficit-ODI-mu_c-blur).

### What is effect of the order of the blur vs the difference-of-Gaussians?

Shown below are the effects of the blur on the maximum responses in the cases where the blur filter occurs *after* and *before* the difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) retinal filter, Figures @fig:response-blur_after_dog and @fig:response-blur_before_dog, respectively.  Biologically it makes more sense for the blur (refractory) filter to occur before the DOG (retinal/LGN) filter but the previous work ([@blais2022modeling]) implemented the blur filter afterward for convenience.  One of the effects is that it takes a larger blur value to produce the same deficit when the DOG filter occurs *after* the blur  -- approximately a factor of 4 larger.  This is due to the fact that the DOG filter enhances high-frequencies so there remain more high-frequency input patterns than if the DOG filter occurs before the blur.  The maximum responses are larger in the case of the DOG filter after the blur because the neuron can achieve a larger level of selectivity and the BCM learning rule has the property that the fixed-point output scales with the selectivity of the neuron.
