# Methods

In this paper we use a specific model of neural plasticity, the BCM model[@BCM82], to describe the dynamics of the recovery from amblyopia under a number of treatment protocols.  Section @sec:introduction.

## Natural Image Input Environment

In order to approximate the visual system, we start with the following basic properties of the retina, LGN and cortex. There are approximately 1000 photoreceptors feeding into 1 ganglion cell [@JeonEtAl1998;@SterlingEtAl1988]. The retina/LGN responses show a center-surround organization, but with a center diameter less than 1$^o$ [@hubel1995eye]

We use natural scene stimuli for the simulated inputs to the visual system. We start with images taken with a digital camera, with dimensions 1200 pixels by 1600 pixels and 40$^o$ by 60$^o$ real-world angular dimensions (Figure @fig:orig). Photoreceptors have a logarithmic response to the stimulus, so we apply the natural logarithm to the pixel values.  Finally, we model the ganglion responses using a 32x32 pixel center-surround difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) filter to process the images, each pixel representing one photoreceptor (Figure @fig:orig). The center-surround radius ratio used for the ganglion cell is 1:3, with balanced excitatory and inhibitory regions and normalized Gaussian profiles.
